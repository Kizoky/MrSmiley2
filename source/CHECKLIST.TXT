Check list whether the levels of Smiley I are touched, or they aren't.
In this list, these levels were edited to correct some wrong texture offsets, level glitches, but NOT adding new sectors to it.
For example, these levels will never have 3D Sectors added to it, so they will be compatible with non-ZDoom engine
There may be an expection though.

E1M1 == touched
