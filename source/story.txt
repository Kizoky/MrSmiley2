Story?

This one is the most trickiest of all, trying to tell a story in DOOM
There are multiple problems with it, If I try to approach it it with Strife-style, not everyone will like the mod
If the TC's gameplay will remain pure Vanilla Doom, and I add unskippable/skippable cutscenes it will be regarded just a shit mod that tries to be good, I don't want that.

ATM (2017.06.27) not every level is finished, this TC lacks playable levels, and therefore I still haven't added any ACS script which would involve "cutscenes"

What would be the best then? Short cutscenes or actions.

Mr. Smiley II will have an intro, and it will be a flashback of Smiley Head fighting the invisible Giant Spider, then heading to a "portal", which he would end up in his very own home. He sleeps for 10 years, then he wakes up, the year would be then 2005.
Everything after is a Mr. Smiley Head in a nutshell.
This would be the basic story for the mod, but everything after comes would be just only gags, and maybe something that continues the story.

Rise of the Smiley!
