# DooM 3: Mr. Smiley Head's Safari II official repository
# Current version: Beta v0.52

# Compatibility:
 I tried making the mod compatible with older ZDoom versions, but after a while I completely changed my mind.
 The mod requires GZDoom 3.2.4 or higher, using lower versions of GZDoom is not recommended due to exploits
 
# Other:
+Can be played with FREEDOOM
-+It can be played with DOOM.WAD, but ATM it isn't supported, please use DOOM2.wad
# Incompatible:
- Skulltag
- Zandronum
- ZDoom 2.8.1 and lower, lower than GZDoom 3.2.0

## Building the pk3:
# Windows:
After you downloaded the zip, don't forget to extract the folder, then run the BUILD.bat file in order to build the Mr_SmileyII.pk3 file
The pk3 file will be placed where you ran the BUILD.bat file in the first place
ie.: "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Mr_SmileyII\Mr_SmileyII.pk3"
# Unix:
Same as for Windows, but instead of build.bat, run the "build" file which will build the PK3 for you
_________________________________________________________________
# Without building the pk3:

Extract the .zip file to the desktop (or anywhere else), then drag the folder over the ZDoom.exe(or GZDoom.exe; or Zandronum.exe)
(I don't know If this will work on non-Windows OSes)
