//At the end of each level the player will be scored. This idea is just for fun.
//Planned: -Total obtainable points (5 points Zombieman, 10 points Shotgunguy, 15 points Chaingunguy, etc. etc.)
//	   -Dev's score (basically, my own score. Just for fun)
//	   -Dev's best time (Speedrunning on my own game?)
//The following will impact the score: Everytime the player takes damage, it will lower the score, so not everyone will have the same score.
//currently I don't know how will I implement this.
