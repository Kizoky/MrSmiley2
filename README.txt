This is the Zandronum 2.1.2 version for Mr. Smiley II (2017. September 02)
It's no longer updated, and will never be.
Please use the latest version of Zandronum from here: https://zandronum.com/download

For those who don't know, the only difference between Zandronum and ZDoom version is the weapon bobbing, nothing much.
In the future, please use the ZDoom version If you use Zandronum!
