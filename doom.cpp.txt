The wandering soul never sleeps, it's seeks for refurbishment.
Skulls clipping, torches blowing, blood flowing.
Darkness came for you to eat you away.
You are a fool for going for that path.
It's either you, or YOU.
You never look back, do you?
Let's have dinner with death.
No hard feelings, soulless.
Your blood is running out, can't you hear it?
Bones crushing at the speed of hell running on earth.
Humanity is it's own hatred, there's no hatred outside.
Walking down and down until you hang yourself.
Kill YourSelf
Hatred is crippling.
Do you seek the imaginary fly-ape?
I HiGhLy DoUbT ThAt YoU WiLl SuRvIvE ThIs
Humans can't be cured, they are abnormal.
I live in this place, leave, human scum.
